   2. Binary Search
   3. Jump Search
3. **Data Structures:**
   1. Linked Lists (Singly and Doubly)
   2. Stacks
   3. Queues
   4. Hash Tables
   5. Binary Trees

## Contributing

If you would like to help me write better algorithms feel free to download the contents of this repository and add to the tests I have written. If you find a fault in my algorithm or see I missed an edge case in my tests feel free to make an issue or a pull request with the error you received and what behavior you expected and why. I will update my code and run your tests and will make sure to add you to the CONTRIBUTORS.md file.
